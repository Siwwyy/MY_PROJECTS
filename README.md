<================================================================>

HELLO, My name is Damian and here I created a little
repository with my own ideas. Enjoy, check this out!
I hope so that these projects will be helpful and make
a good job with daily programming.

Repository contains following projects:
------------------------------------------------------

1. Algorithms_Library -> I created own "Library" 
with my algorithms created during my ASD I and ASD II
lectures and IT classes. Description of Algorithms enrolled to 
library below:
1. Bubble_Sort and Shake_Sort
2. Euqlides Algorithm
3. Linear Serach
4. Binary Serach
5. Hash Table
6. Heap Sort
7. MST graph (Prim's method)
8. Pattern Seeking (Karp Rabin's method)

------------------------------------------------------

2. Key_Logger -> My key logger with detection the key press or
mouse moves in any window ! Additionaly I wrote small remote
logs (created by key logger) e-mail mailbox. If infected computer
has a internet connection my key logger will send (after specifed
time) e-mail with logs.

You need to configure the destination e-mail in config.in file,
Examplary file:

e-mail: xyz@zyx.com
